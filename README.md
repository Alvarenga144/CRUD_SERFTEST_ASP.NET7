## Project History 📖

This project was developed as part of a technical test for SERFINSA El Salvador for a Junior Developer position. The objective was to implement full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database using C# .NET and MVC. The choice of libraries, style, and interface design was left to my discretion, and I successfully completed the project within the required time frame. 💻
